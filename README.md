# DATA-200 Final Project
Intro to Data Analytics Final Project (Death percentage of heart failure for patients in ICU)<br>
For my final project, I’m classifying death rate/percentage of patients in ICU with heart failure. I retrieved this data set, ‘Heart Failure Clinical Record Dataset’, from University of California, Irvine’s, Machine Learning Repository Website under the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.<br>
I'm using ROC(receiver operating characteristic curve) to get the best possible classifier to predict death percentage of heart failture for patients in ICU.
